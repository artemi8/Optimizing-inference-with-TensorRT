# Optimize Tensorflow Models For Deployment with TensorRT

## Project Objective

1. Optimize Tensorflow models using TF-TRT.
2. Use TF-TRT to optimize several deep learning models at FP32, FP16, and INT8 precision.
3. Observe how tuning TF-TRT parameters affects performance and inference throughput.

This is the project done from Coursera Project Network [course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/tensorflow-tensorrt)
